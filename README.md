# SynapseFI-with-React-Redux

This is a simple budget app with the Synapse API, using Synapse's Node.js library.

## To get started:

Please have `npm` installed.

Now we need to install all necessary dependencies for the app to work.

In the project directory, please run:

`npm i`

and then run:

`cd client && npm i`

After installing all necessary dependencies, switch back to the root folder:

`cd ..`

## To test the app:

### `npm run dev`

Use this to test the app. Runs both client and server in development mode.

### Message commands to send:
- `What is my bank balance?`
- `What are my nodes?`
- `What is my budget?`
- `Set Budget to $XXXX.XX`
- `How much did I spend this month?` 
- `How much did I spend on <NODE_NICKNAME>`
- `What is my balance?`
- `What are my savings?`
- `What are my checkings?`


If you want to run client or server separately:

### `npm run client`

Runs the client code and opens the browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm run server`

Runs the server code at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

Server will reload if you make edits.
